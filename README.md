GeoSES is a a composite index that summarizes the main dimensions of the Brazilian socioeconomic context for research purposes. We created the index from the 2010 Brazilian Census, whose variables selection was guided by theoretical references for health studies.

The paper explaining the methodology and validation of the index can be acessed at https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0232074

GeoSES was created in three geographic scales: 

+intraurban level for municipalities with more than 3 sample areas

+Federal Units (States) for the 27 Units in Brazil

+national level, taking into account all the 5,565 municipalities in 2010

GeoSES Data are available as .csv files. 

Shapefiles for the sample areas are available at: https://geoftp.ibge.gov.br/recortes_para_fins_estatisticos/malha_de_areas_de_ponderacao/censo_demografico_2010/

Shapefiles for the municipalities of the whole country are available by UF (2010) and need to be joined - https://geoftp.ibge.gov.br/organizacao_do_territorio/malhas_territoriais/malhas_municipais/municipio_2010/

The shapefile with united municipalities for the whole country is available from 2015 (with new municipalities: 5,572) and the divisions by UFs (BRUFE250GC_SIR.shp) - https://geoftp.ibge.gov.br/organizacao_do_territorio/malhas_territoriais/malhas_municipais/municipio_2015/Brasil/
